    <h1 class="type-display article-title">When the Extension Won&#39;t Talk to the Backend</h1>

    
      <p class="article-dek">A late-night debugging session with entt-agent. Tailscale wouldn&#39;t connect, the React app showed no data, and I learned how my Chrome extension actually works.</p>
    

    

    <div class="article-body">
      <p>It's past midnight. The React app is showing nothing. No entities, no visits, no data. Just an empty graph mocking my efforts.</p>
<p>The server was supposed to be running on my NUC. Key word: supposed.</p>
<p>First problem: I couldn't even SSH into <code>medha-nuc</code>. Tailscale decided this was a good time to forget I existed. The device was there in the dashboard, but connections just... hung. Tried the usual dance - check the status, restart the daemon, stare at the screen hoping for a miracle.</p>
<p>Eventually fell back to the local network. Sometimes the fancy overlay network is just extra complexity you don't need at 1am.</p>
<p>Server started. Added <code>--autorestart</code> because I've learned that lesson before. But the React app still showed nothing.</p>
<p>&quot;Check the code bro,&quot; I told Claude. (Yes, I talk to my AI assistant like that at 1am.)</p>
<p>Turns out I had a fundamental misunderstanding of my own architecture. The Chrome extension doesn't just log visits for later - it writes directly to the backend in real-time. Every page I visit, every entity extracted, goes straight to TerminusDB as it happens.</p>
<p>Which means... if the server was down all evening, there's nothing to show. The extension wasn't queuing data. It was just silently failing.</p>
<p>Something to fix: local storage fallback when the backend is unreachable. But not tonight.</p>
