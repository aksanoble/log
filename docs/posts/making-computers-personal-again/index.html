<p>The computer stopped being personal. Most of the apps I use on my computer today is on the browser. The data I create and view just rests somewhere else. It's anything but personal. Even development is moving to the cloud with @replit and @glitch<br><br>What's the problem? Data silo-isation, lack of insight into your own data, privacy...<br><br>The only way out is for everyone to have a personal computer on the cloud. This computer manages all identity, data and communication with the world. <br><br>Everyone already has a personal @Dropbox or @googledrive i.e storage. But just storage isn't a computer. We need to bring processing and RAM to everyone. <br>This will not only empower individuals to own all their data and bring privacy but also finally free up developers from the whole dev-ops saga. Not kubernetes or even render. This is truly going serverless for the developer. Developers can focus on building experiences/views over data. What are the features that this personal computer need to have? <br><br>Open source<br>Permissive license<br>Shared Database across apps (perhaps using @SolidMit + @GraphQL )<br>Web server<br>Task Runner / Queue<br>Automator like Zapier <br>Cron<br>Functions <br>Who's already working on this? <br>@urbit @SandstormIO @cozycloud https://protos.io @inrupt <br><br><br>@urbit : A completely different universe with it's own stars. https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/star/ Complete with it's own OS, Networking protocol. Seems to have the steepest learning curve for developer adoption. <br><br>@SandstormIO : A project perhaps ahead of it's time.  Crowdfunded on @Indiegogo by the visionary @KentonVarda back in 2014. The project moved to being community run in 2017. They support one click installations of @gitlab @RocketChat. That said it looks like @SandstormIO needs more dev support, adoption and most importantly funds. <br><br>@cozycloud : "Built in France not in California". Featured open source apps, built in-house. A password manager, a Google Drive alternative, A notes app, and an app to manage bank accounts. The platform is open source and can be self hosted. Free for upto 5GB. @cozycloud Could do with more developer adoption. Impressive project all. <br><br>protos.io: Very early stage and seems to be using a docker centric approach for applications. According to them they're in "dire needs of extra development hands".<br><br>Overall both as an end user as well as well as a developer I would love to see some consolidation here. This will help drive more developers and in turn end users. Monopolies aren't all that bad? <br><br>I wonder if @GraphQL centric personal cloud computer can be built. It already has a ton of developer adoption, a foundation driving standard. Porting existing apps should be relatively easy. @HasuraHQ are you listening? <br><br>The space is still quite new. I believe has the potential to change SaaS as we know today and can make data ownership and privacy default and by design. <br><br>Who's positioned to be successful and can get into this space? <br>No-code platforms, cloud companies. So @airtable @Firebase @awscloud @Azure @HasuraHQ @render @heroku <br><br></p></div>
