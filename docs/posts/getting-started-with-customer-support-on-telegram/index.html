<p>For any business customer support and addressing queries is absolutely essential. While large businesses have elaborate CRM (Customer Relationship Management) systems, small business owners generally need something much more simple.</p><p>Today we can already see businesses using WhatsApp extensively to interact and engage with their customers with their WhatsApp Business account.</p><p>While WhatsApp Business account works great for addressing customer queries there are a few caveats.</p><ul><li>Restricted API access. (WhatsApp business API is currently available only for medium and large businesses only)</li><li>Need to have a separate phone number for your business.</li><li>Restrictions on the number of users you can broadcast your message. (Currently 256)</li></ul><p>To navigate around some of these restrictions businesses can leverage another popular messaging platform Telegram. Let's see how Telegram addresses some of the above concerns.</p><ul><li>Open API access.</li><li>You can create a Bot account for your business without having to have a separate phone number.</li><li>No limits on number of contacts or messages. (Has a generous rate limit of 30 messages / second)</li></ul><h3>How to start engaging your customers on Telegram.</h3><h4>Create separate Telegram business identity</h4><p>There are two types of accounts on Telegram.</p><ul><li>User account</li><li>Bot account</li></ul><p>If you want to get a user account you need to have a separate phone number. We recommend creating a Bot account instead. Some advantages for why a Bot account makes more sense for businesses.</p><ul><li>Independent Business identity, not tied to a phone number.</li><li>Easy to integrate self-service features for customers</li><li>Easy API for broadcast messages.</li><li>Seamlessly move to a full fledged CRM while retaining the same Telegram Business identity.</li></ul><p>How to create a Telegram Bot?</p><p>Yes, there's a bot for that. Please follow the instructions given here. <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot">https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot</a></p><h4>Managing your Bot with Telebooth</h4><p>While it's very easy to create a new Telegram Bot identity, managing the same is far from trivial. Generally businesses connect the Telegram Bot token with a CRM such as <a href="http://respond.io">respond.io</a>, freshchat etc to start managing 1-1 conversations reaching out to the Bot.</p><p>If you're looking for a simpler self-managed solution you can consider using <a href="https://telebooth.kanthi.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Telebooth</a> to manage your Telegram Bot.
